      <h2>About me</h2> 
      <h3>Personal life</h3>
      <p> I was born in north Georgia and my family moved to eastern Kentucky in August 2007. I live with my 
      mom, dad, and sister who have given me amazing support for everything I do, and Penny has been with us 
      since she was about a year old. I have a huge extended family that takes us on vacation most years. 
      I am currently dorming with my sister since we attend the same college. </p> 
      <h3>Employment</h3>
      <p> My first job was at Spirit Halloween in 2022, where I would mostly tidy the sales floor but also 
      cashier sometimes. My second job was at Outback Steakhouse in the spring and into summer of 2024, where 
      I greeted people and led them to their tables. Since September, I have worked as a tutor (for five classes!) 
      on-campus at Northern Kentucky University. I am currently the only tutor for ASL 110. I also started 
      working as a Student Wellness Education Ambassador, meaning I work for their tabling events and spread 
      awareness of wellness resources around campus.</p>
      <h3>Personal interests</h3>
      <p> Film is my biggest passion. I love watching movies, talking about movies, writing about movies, anything 
      to do with movies. I love horror movies most because of the conversations that surround them and the 
      special effects. I was able to finally decide my college major thanks to a documentary about special 
      effects makeup. My second biggest passion is music, especially George Michael's. I have a dedicated 
      shelf for CDs and cassettes of his albums and singles. I think it was fate that <i>Patience</i>, my 
      favorite album, was released very close to my birthday. His video for "Freeek!" made me sure of my 
      choice of major. <br> <br>
